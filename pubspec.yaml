  # The following defines the version and build number for your application.
  # A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
  # followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
  # Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
  # build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
  # In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

    # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
    assets:
      - assets/images/
      - assets/images/welcome/
      - assets/icons/

    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see

    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
    fonts:
      - family: home
        fonts:
          - asset: assets/fonts/ic_home.ttf

      - family: home-outline
